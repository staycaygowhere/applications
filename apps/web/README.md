## Developing

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/staycaygowhere/applications
```

2. Install the node modules / depedencies - we are using `workspaces` so all `node_modules` in the sub `package.json`'s
will get installed

```
npm install
```

3. Change to the relevant `app` project directory.

```
cd apps/template
```

4. Begin development

npm run dev
```
